Extraterrestrial-Irradiance
===========================

LabView VIs for teaching and illustration of Earth-Sun geometry and to calculate extraterrestrial irradiance. The installation contains the following VI's:

Top-level VI
===============



Sub-VIs
===============

* declination_angle.vi - calculates the approximate solar declination in radians at a given time of year using a simplified equation.
* hour_angle.vi - for a given mean local time (hours of day since midnight) calculates the hour angle in radians.
* zenith_angle - determines the zenith angle in radians for a given location (latitude) and time (day of year, time of day)
